PokerDice
=========

Multi-player Poker Dice game with GUI

Poker dice are similar to the classic 6-sided dice, except each of the 6 sides
contains a classic playing card (all in the suit spades) on its side instead of
a number of pips. The faces of a poker die are thus 9, 10, jack, queen, king and
ace of spades.

The GUI will display 5 poker dice and the player will be able to roll the dice.
The dice are sorted, and then the player will be able to select 0 to 5 dice to
re-roll, and the "hand" is reported according to poker rules.

For the multiplayer version, the players will share one set of dice, and take
turns rolling the dice. When each players has completed their rolls, the winner
will be announced.
